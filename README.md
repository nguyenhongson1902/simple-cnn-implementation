A simple way of implementing CNN architectures. The problem is to build a classification model.
*Tutorial from*: freeCodeCamp, Youtube

## Main requirements
- tensorflow 2.x
- matplotlib
- keras (available in the Tensorflow package)

## Version
Python 3.9.7
Tensorflow 2.6.0

## Environment
Anaconda, Windows 10

## How to use
In the terminal, run `python train.py` to train my model, run `python train.py -p` to train a model created from another pre-trained model (`-p` stands for the `pretrained` flag)

## Datasets
CIFAR-10 (https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html). It contains 60,000 32x32 color images with 6000 images of each class.

The labels in this dataset are the following:
- Airplane
- Automobile
- Bird
- Cat
- Deer
- Dog
- Frog
- Horse
- Ship
- Truck
